He displays a knack for both heroism and mischief, as seen when he heroically pulls a magical sword from a stone in Maplewich, fulfilling a prophecy, and later participates in thefts alongside Opal at the black market. Eugene’s pragmatic approach often leads him to questionable actions, such as robbing others to fund the party’s goals or willingly engaging in morally ambiguous missions. He embraces the chaotic nature of the campaign, aligning with the unpredictable flow of events—whether it’s helping free prisoners to start a riot in Xanathar’s lair or being infected by a mysterious disease linked to his sword. Eugene’s arc embodies both the triumphs and trials of the party, making him a critical yet unpredictable element in their journey.' },
