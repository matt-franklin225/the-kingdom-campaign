They band together to defend the tavern and later meet Volothamp Geddarm, who hires them to find his missing friend, Floon Blagmaar. Their quest plunges them into a web of intrigue involving rival factions, particularly the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild, as they uncover the mysterious Stone of Golorr, an artifact tied to hidden treasures within the city. After establishing their base at Trollskull Manor and transforming it into the Mickey Mavern Club Tavern, their ambitions are shattered when a tragic fireball incident leads to several deaths, including their ally Durnan, forcing the party to confront guilt and mistrust among themselves.
