He displays a knack for both heroism and mischief, as seen when he heroically pulls a magical sword from a stone in Maplewich, fulfilling a prophecy, and later participates in thefts alongside Opal at the black market. Eugene’s pragmatic approach often leads him to questionable actions, such as robbing others to fund the party’s goals or willingly engaging in morally ambiguous missions. He embraces the chaotic nature of the campaign, aligning with the unpredictable flow of events—whether it’s helping free prisoners to start a riot in Xanathar’s lair or being infected by a mysterious disease linked to his sword. Eugene’s arc embodies both the triumphs and trials of the party, making him a critical yet unpredictable element in their journey.' },
    { id: '2', loc: 'pluto_johnson', imgUrl: pluto, name: 'Pluto Johnson', title: 'Lord of the Golden Order', class: 'Wizard', race: 'Human', alignment: 'Lawful Neutral', age: '33', birthplace: 'Sword Coast', otherTitle: 'Majordomo to the High King', description: 'Pluto Johnson is a cunning and versatile member of the party, known for his morally gray actions and adaptability. Throughout the campaign, he takes on multiple roles, including disguising himself as "The Red Death" to cover for Opal’s mistakes and engaging in high-stakes encounters with thieves, nobles, and even a red dragon. Pluto’s quick thinking often puts him at the forefront of chaotic situations—like successfully robbing stores under cover of Opal’s antics—and his ambition is reflected in acquiring powerful magic items, including a blade of shadows. While he plays a crucial role in battles, his impulsive decisions, such as drawing from the Deck of Many Things, hint at a reckless streak. Despite his questionable actions, Pluto remains an integral part of the party’s success and shares a complicated camaraderie with the others, particularly during tense moments like the trial and the final confrontation with Mirt.' },

A versatile spellcaster, Ariah often relies on his radiant powers and elemental magic to aid the party but isn’t afraid to act decisively—even ruthlessly—when necessary. His decision to burn Mirt alive in his armor to prevent the Harpers from seizing the vault’s gold reveals his willingness to make extreme choices, straining his relationships with other party members. Ariah harbors personal guilt and unresolved trauma, including the revelation that he was raised by wolves he later discovers were slain by Berrían, adding layers of emotional depth to his character. His growing distrust of his companions and fixation on uncovering secrets create tension, especially with Opal. Ariah’s intricate web of actions and relationships makes him a pivotal yet unpredictable figure whose choices shape the party’s dynamics and future.' },
    { id: '4', loc: 'opal_blade', imgUrl: opal, name: 'Opal Blade', title: 'Brightcandle of Fireshallow', class: 'Monk', race: 'Tabaxi', alignment: 'Neutral', age: '28', birthplace: 'Waterdeep', otherTitle: 'Weapon of the High King', description: 'Opal Blade is an impulsive and unpredictable monk whose chaotic actions often blur the line between brilliance and madness. Haunted by trauma connected to the Xanathar Guild and her backstory with a mind flayer, Opal struggles with fear and sanity throughout the campaign. Her eccentric behavior includes everything from wearing a skull as a helmet to crashing parties claiming to be Death incarnate. She is fiercely independent yet occasionally reckless, as shown when she attacks the mind flayer head-on, drinks pints with magical effects, and murders a hostage in her delirium. Opal’s relationships with the party are complex—her unstable actions create friction, particularly with Ariah, but moments of genuine care shine through, such as when she arranges for Berrían’s son to return to his village. Despite her chaotic tendencies, Opal is a formidable fighter whose boldness and unpredictability are key assets to the party, even if her actions often leave destruction in their wake.' },
    { id: '5', loc: 'sarenia_valen', imgUrl: sarenia, name: 'Sarenia Valen', title: 'Exalted Songbird of Fireshallow', class: 'Bard', race: 'Half-Elf', alignment: 'Chaotic Good', age: '26', birthplace: 'United Gaerid Empire', otherTitle: 'Heir of Newend', description: 'Sarenia Valen is a talented bard whose charm, wit, and musical prowess often mask her role as the party’s emotional anchor and occasional voice of reason. While she participates in the group’s schemes, such as disguising herself to infiltrate noble houses and performing at festivals to promote the Mickey Mavern Club Tavern, Sarenia often finds herself mediating conflicts between party members. She showcases diplomacy and empathy, earning the trust of both friends and foes—such as gaining the drow spy’s confidence and promising Violet freedom, even though that plan ultimately falters. Sarenia’s actions extend beyond music, as she demonstrates sharp tactical skills during the trial, leveraging her courtroom savvy to save the party from ruin. However, her ability to navigate tense situations is tested by the group’s growing instability. Whether leading in battle with bardic inspiration or healing emotional wounds, Sarenia balances pragmatism and compassion, standing as a stabilizing force in an increasingly chaotic party.' },
    { id: '6', loc: 'berrian_berevan', imgUrl: berrian, name: 'Berrían Berevan', title: 'Elder of Ashenveil Forest', class: 'Ranger', race: 'Wood Elf', alignment: 'Chaotic Neutral', age: '220', birthplace: 'Elderleaf Grove', otherTitle: '???', description: 'Berrían Berevan is a brooding and deeply conflicted ranger whose past haunts him as much as his actions in the present. Known for his sharp skills in combat and wilderness survival, Berrían struggles with guilt and anger, especially regarding his strained relationship with his family and the mysterious enmity he holds toward the drow Violet. His emotional turmoil peaks when, in a fit of rage, he accidentally kills Violet by setting her on fire, triggering a crisis that drives him into isolation. The discovery that his estranged son, Orrían, has left their village adds another layer to his inner conflict. Berrían’s dual nature—caught between his duty to the party and unresolved personal burdens—makes him unpredictable. Though he is a reliable ally in battle, Berrían’s emotional volatility threatens the group’s cohesion. His tragic death at the hands of a drow assassin leaves behind lingering questions and forces the party to reckon with both their loyalty to each other and the price of unresolved regrets.' },
