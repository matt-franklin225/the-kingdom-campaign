    { id: '1', loc: 'eugene_rider', imgUrl: eugene, name: 'Eugene Rider', title: 'High King of Fireshallow', class: 'Rogue', race: 'Human', alignment: 'Lawful Good', age: '25', birthplace: 'Yellowseed', otherTitle: 'The Rogue Monarch', description: 'Forced to flee his hometown of Yellowseed as a young child after it was razed by a horde of goblins, eventually being taken in by a gang of young thieves in Waterdeep. Eugene was raised in the way of street criminals before being caught by the law and forced to flee Waterdeep. He married young and had a young daughter, Quinn, but after his wife\'s untimely death he fled once more, finding his way back to Waterdeep as an adult and joining the adventurers. Eugene implemented his skills to great effect with his new comrades, using everything from disguise kits to lockpicks to reach new places and taking down enemies with his bow, knives, and rapier. After he and the party obtained the gold from Waterdeep and departed, he entered a small town and drew Shadowbane--a sword of tremendous power--from a stone. Following his newly obtained destiny from this sword, he slayed the mind flayer who ruled the kingdom of Fireshallow--saving his daughter and friends in the process--and became the new king of Fireshallow.' },
