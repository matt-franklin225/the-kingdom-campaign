He displays a knack for both heroism and mischief, as seen when he heroically pulls a magical sword from a stone in Maplewich, fulfilling a prophecy, and later participates in thefts alongside Opal at the black market. Eugene’s pragmatic approach often leads him to questionable actions, such as robbing others to fund the party’s goals or willingly engaging in morally ambiguous missions. He embraces the chaotic nature of the campaign, aligning with the unpredictable flow of events—whether it’s helping free prisoners to start a riot in Xanathar’s lair or being infected by a mysterious disease linked to his sword.

Throughout the campaign, he takes on multiple roles, including disguising himself as "The Red Death" to cover for Opal’s mistakes and engaging in high-stakes encounters with thieves, nobles, and even a red dragon. Pluto’s quick thinking often puts him at the forefront of chaotic situations—like successfully robbing stores under cover of Opal’s antics—and his ambition is reflected in acquiring powerful magic items, including a blade of shadows. While he plays a crucial role in battles, his impulsive decisions, such as drawing from the Deck of Many Things, hint at a reckless streak. Despite his questionable actions, Pluto remains an integral part of the party’s success and shares a complicated camaraderie with the others, particularly during tense moments like the trial and the final confrontation with Mirt.' },

Haunted by trauma connected to the Xanathar Guild and her backstory with a mind flayer, Opal struggles with fear and sanity throughout the campaign. Her eccentric behavior includes everything from wearing a skull as a helmet to crashing parties claiming to be Death incarnate. She is fiercely independent yet occasionally reckless, as shown when she attacks the mind flayer head-on, drinks pints with magical effects, and murders a hostage in her delirium. Opal’s relationships with the party are complex—her unstable actions create friction, particularly with Ariah, but moments of genuine care shine through, such as when she arranges for Berrían’s son to return to his village. Despite her chaotic tendencies, Opal is a formidable fighter whose boldness and unpredictability are key assets to the party, even if her actions often leave destruction in their wake.' },

She showcases diplomacy and empathy, earning the trust of both friends and foes—such as gaining the drow spy’s confidence and promising Violet freedom, even though that plan ultimately falters. Sarenia’s actions extend beyond music, as she demonstrates sharp tactical skills during the trial, leveraging her courtroom savvy to save the party from ruin. However, her ability to navigate tense situations is tested by the group’s growing instability.

His emotional turmoil peaks when, in a fit of rage, he accidentally kills Violet by setting her on fire, triggering a crisis that drives him into isolation. The discovery that his estranged son, Orrían, has left their village adds another layer to his inner conflict. Berrían’s dual nature—caught between his duty to the party and unresolved personal burdens—makes him unpredictable. Though he is a reliable ally in battle, Berrían’s emotional volatility threatens the group’s cohesion. His tragic death at the hands of a drow assassin leaves behind lingering questions and forces the party to reckon with both their loyalty to each other and the price of unresolved regrets.' },

Throughout the party’s journey, Leg frequently offers up sacrifices to Avandra (who among other things is a deity of luck), bestowing good fortune to the party. Unfortunately, this often comes with social consequences, with Leg’s unceasing sacrifices bringing about disagreements among many of his fellow party members. This devotion continued as the party took command of the kingdom of Fireshallow, with Leg establishing a church to honor Avandra near the castle. His loyalty and dedication extends to the party as well, as his consistent strength in battle helped to bring the party to victory in difficult situations such as the dungeon of the Mad Mage. Overall, Leg’s unwavering spirit brings a positive influence to the chaotic team, giving them divine aid on their path to many victories' },
